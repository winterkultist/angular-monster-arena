# Pipes

Knowledge about Angular Pipes hooks is needed

## Built-In Pipes

The time in the footer is of standard javascript Date output. This is ugly. Can this be improved?

- Change the footer output to a better format. Use an Angular Pipe!

## Element Pipe

- There is an ugly if block in monster-badge. Maybe you can write your own pipe to render the right emoji?
- Search for other parts in the project where this pipe can be used
