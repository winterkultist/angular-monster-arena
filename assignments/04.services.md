## Write a Date service

The footer calls new Date(). It is better to leave something central like this to it's own service.

- Write a simple Service (called `DateService`) with a method `getCurrentDate(): Date`
  - Use it in footer instead of calling new Date() directly

## Reactivity?

- Add a functionality, when the user clicks on the clock symbol to forward the time by one day.
  - Do it in the component first
  - Afterward, write a function `forwardDate()` in the `DateService`
    - Hint: This won't work, but you will find out why, in the next lesson

## Notification

- Write a notification component to display some notification message.
  - Make it display on the bottom of the page (fixed)
    - You can do it like floating-footer component
  - Give it some warning colors
  - Write a NotificationService with a public method showNotification(string)
    - On calling this method from anywhere this NotificationComponent should display this message
  - Replace all window.alert in the project with calls to the NotificationService
