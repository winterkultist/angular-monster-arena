# Directives

### Required knowledge

Angular Directives

## Built-in Directives

The image in the monster card is very cumbersomely written. A big @if statement just for a single css class change.

- Rewrite the img of the right card to us the built-in Angular directive ngClass

## Write your own Directive

- Write a directive `hover` that changes the background of an element when the mouse enters over
  - Hint: This is the exact example from angular.dev !
