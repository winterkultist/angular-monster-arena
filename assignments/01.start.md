# Start

### Required knowledge

## Get started with the LAK Monster Arena

- Start the application
- Look at the UI and get accustomed to it

## Warm up - Monster List

Unfortunately monster list has no names.

- Monster list should display names of monsters. Replace the TODO placeholder

## Component Diagram

- Cooperatively draw a complete component diagram of the application on the whiteboard

## Extract Waiting Card

On the Arena site, there are waiting cards. This is duplicated code. DRY!

- Extract the waiting card and all it's needed styles into a new component
