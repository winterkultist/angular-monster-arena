# Routing

### Required knowledge

Angular Routing
Route Guards

## Creator

- Create a new component create-monster
  - It does not need to do anything yet
  - We will just use it to navigate.

## Navigation

- Introduce routing in this application
  - It should have the routes:
    - /monsters
    - /arena
    - /creator
  - Clean the stupid @if in the app component

## Monster Data Refactoring

AppComponent can't communicate with monster-list anymore.

- Write a Service that holds the monster array
- Wire it to the monster-list component with Signals

## Route Guard

- Write a user service
  - It should have a method getUser() that retrieves a user object
  - That user object should have a field role of type string
    - For now mock the result with a literal user object that has the role 'ADMIN'
    - Add a TODO there, we will need it at a later stage
- Write a route guard for the creator page
  - Only if the user is an admin (the role === 'ADMIN') it is allowed to navigate to this site
  - If the user does not have the role ADMIN they should be redirected to /monsters instead

## Monster Detail page

- Create a Monster detail page
  - It should show all relevant information of a monster
  - The design should look like it belongs to this page
  - You can navigate to this page by clicking a badge in monster list
  - The url should have the name of the monster
    - eg: `/monsters/lavalak`
- The site should have a round button with a giant X on it's top right side to go back to the monster list
