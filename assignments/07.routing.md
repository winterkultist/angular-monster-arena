# Routing

Knowledge about Angular Routing is required.

## Navigation

- Introduce routing in this application
  - It should have the routes:
    - /content
    - /arena
    - /creator
  - Clean the stupid @if in the app component

## Route Guard

- Write a user service
  - It should have a method getUser() that retrieves a user object
  - That user object should have a field role of type string
    - For now mock the result with a literal user object that has the role 'ADMIN'
    - Add a TODO there, we will need it at a later stage
- Write a route guard for the creator page
  - Only if the user is an admin (the role === 'ADMIN') it is allowed to navigate to this site
