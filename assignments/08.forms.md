### Required knowledge

Angular Reactive Forms
Validation

## Creator

At first we will create a few simple fields to create a new Monster.
This will not have all possible fields for a Monsert yet.

- Write a simple html form for creating a new Monster.
  - It should have
    - A text input for the name
    - A drop-down for an element
      - FIRE should be pre-selected as default
    - A number input for maxEnergy
    - a number input for maxHealth
  - There should be a `CREATE!` button
    - On click a new Monster is created and logged into the console
      - Hint: Add mocked parts to the new Monster so the type matches. These fields will be created later
    - On click the form should reset to its default stage

## Validators

Right now a rather broken Monster can be created. This should be improved with validation

- Configure the following fields with validators
  - name should be required
  - maxEnergy and maxHealth should be greater than 0 but smaller than 100
- If the form in invalid, the `CREATE!` button should be disabled
