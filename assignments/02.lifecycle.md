# Lifecycle

### Required knowledge

Angular Lifecycle hooks

## Waiting Animation

In your waiting card component there is a small "animation", but it only starts when you click on the card.

- Make the animation start when the component is initialized.

## Pollution

Does this interval pollute anything?

- Write a console.log message inside this interval animation and watch the browser console.

## Clean Up

Every component should clean up after itself.

- If WaitingCard is not used anymore, clean it up
  - Hint: There is a `clearInterval(id)` which accepts the intervalId you get when creating with `setInterval(...)`
    - Hint: In Typescript this id is of type `ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>`
