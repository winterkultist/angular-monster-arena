# Content Projection

### Required knowledge

Angular Content projection of components

## Better Readable Forms

Right now, label and form fields use a lot of duplicated code.
We should create a component that handles layout and label.
The form fields themselves can be very different but are also part of the layout of this new component.
This won't work if the form fields and your new component are siblings. You will have to use Angulars content projection.

- Write a new component `form-field`
  - It has an @Input for label
  - It displays a complete row of your form
  - But the right hand input itself is projected
