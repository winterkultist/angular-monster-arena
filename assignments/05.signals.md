# Signals

### Required knowledge

Angular Signals

## Date Footer

- In the Footer component, rewrite the now variable to be a signal
- Write a derived boolean Signal isWeekend from this now date.
  - If it is weekend change the color of the footer

## Forward time

- Rewrite the `DateService` to have a Signal inside itself.
  - Update the `forwardDate()` method.

Now reactivity should work! :)
  
## State Management with Services

It is very unpractical how Monsters are added to the arena.

- Analyze how a monster is added and collaboratively add it to the component diagramm from lesson 01.start

- Write an `ArenaService` to hold the selected Monsters.
- Write all needed functions to add and read them
- Use Signals towire it correctly
